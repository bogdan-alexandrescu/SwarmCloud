# Requests against the frozen contract

`apps/common/swarm_common/` is frozen. CLAUDE.md rule 1 is explicit about what
to do when you believe it needs to change: *say so instead of changing it.* This
file is where that is said, so a request survives the session that found it.

Nothing here is applied unless its **Status** line says so. Each entry states the
defect, the proof, what the change would be, and — the part that decides whether
it is worth it — what breaks downstream if it is made, and what is left for
somebody to live with if it is declined.

These are requests for a person to decide. Nothing in this file is a plan.

## 1. `identity.py`: the `u-` prefix does not namespace personal tenants

**Status:** open, found 2026-09-18 by an audit agent that correctly declined to
edit the frozen module itself.

### The claim that is false

`apps/common/swarm_common/identity.py:88`:

```python
def tenant_id_for_user(email: str) -> str:
    """Personal fallback tenant, namespaced so it cannot collide with a group."""
    return _slug(email, prefix="u-")
```

It can collide with a group, because the group path adds no prefix at all:

```python
def tenant_id_for_group(group_email: str) -> str:
    return _slug(group_email)
```

`_slug` appends a disambiguating digest only when the slug is *lossy* or *too
long*. A group whose local part is already a clean, short string starting with
`u-` is neither, so it passes through untouched:

| principal | function | tenant id |
|---|---|---|
| `u-eng@saga.xyz` (a group) | `tenant_id_for_group` | `u-eng` |
| `eng@saga.xyz` (a user) | `tenant_id_for_user` | `u-eng` |

Same GSA, same secret prefix, same GCS prefix, same namespace — the cross-tenant
merge invariant 9 exists to prevent. `store.py:232` compounds it by deriving
`kind = "user" if tenant_id.startswith("u-") else "group"`, which assumes
exactly this cannot happen.

### Why it is not yet exploitable, and why that is temporary

`TENANT_GROUPS` was never set by terraform, so `resolve_tenant()` had no groups
to check and there were no registered groups at all. The collision needs one.

That changed on 2026-09-18: `TENANT_GROUPS` is now wired (see
`terraform/infra/locals.tf`). The collision is reachable from the moment a group
whose local part begins with `u-` is registered. No such group exists today, and
nothing stops one being added — `u-` reads naturally as an abbreviation
(`u-eng` for "unified eng"), which is what makes this a trap rather than a
curiosity.

### The requested change

In `_slug`, force the digest branch when a **group** slug would begin with `u-`,
reserving that namespace for personal tenants. Equivalently: give group slugs
their own required prefix. Either makes the docstring's claim true.

### What it would cost — the reason this is a request and not a patch

**Tenant ids are not just identifiers; they are the names of live
infrastructure.** A tenant id appears in a GSA name, a Kubernetes namespace, a
Secret Manager secret name, and a GCS prefix. Re-deriving them means the
platform stops finding the resources it already provisioned.

For the change as scoped, only groups starting with `u-` change id, and there
are none — so the migration is empty *today*. That is precisely why it is worth
doing now and expensive later: the same change made after such a group exists is
a data migration across four services.

Whoever applies it should also add the collision to `tests/unit` as a case, not
merely as a regression guard: `tenant_id_for_group("u-eng@saga.xyz") !=
tenant_id_for_user("eng@saga.xyz")` is the property, and it is currently false.

### The unfrozen half, which does not need this request

Separately from the collision, `_assert_principal_matches` — the only check that
would catch two identities sharing a tenant id — runs *only* inside
`ensure_tenant`, reached only via `SubmissionService.tenant_for()`. The write
paths call it. `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `cancel_task`, `list_events`,
`list_artifacts`, `list_workflows`, `get_workflow` and `cancel_workflow` do not;
they filter Firestore by the raw `tenant_id` string.

That is in `apps/swarm-api/`, which is not frozen, and it is the half that turns
a collision into a cross-tenant **read and cancel**. It should be fixed whether
or not this request is accepted, and the comment at `routes/tasks.py:3-6` —
"there is no request a caller can construct that reads another tenant's task" —
should not be restored until it is true.

---

## 2. `models.py`: `Attempt` records memory and disk, but not tokens or cost

**Status:** APPROVED by the platform owner and APPLIED, 2026-09-19.

The five fields below are now on `Attempt`, and
`agent_worker.control.record_spend` populates them from the summary
`_usage_summary` extracts before truncation. A field the runner did not report
is omitted rather than written as zero -- `None` means "not reported" and `0`
means "cost nothing", and a mock task is genuinely the second while an
unparseable result is the first.

The original request follows, unchanged, as the record of what was asked for.

### What is missing

`Attempt` (`apps/common/swarm_common/models.py:196-215`) carries
`peak_rss_bytes` and `peak_disk_bytes`. It carries no token count and no cost.

So the platform records precisely how much MEMORY an agent used and nothing at
all about what it spent -- on a platform whose entire cost is tokens.

### Why this surfaced now

A per-user activity view ("how many agents, tokens and jobs has each engineer
used") cannot be assembled. Two separate obstacles, one now fixed:

1. **The numbers were being thrown away.** `lifecycle.py` wrapped the runner
   result in `_truncate_json(..., 8000)`, which replaces an oversized result
   with a preview *string*. Long runs exceed 8000 characters, so the attempts
   that consumed the most tokens were exactly the ones whose token counts were
   discarded. Fixed on the unfrozen side: `_usage_summary()` now extracts
   `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, cache counts, `thinking_tokens`,
   `total_cost_usd`, `num_turns` and the model list *before* truncation, into
   the free-form runner summary.

2. **There is still nowhere typed to put them.** The values now reach Firestore
   inside an untyped dict. Nothing can query them, no index can cover them, and
   every reader must know the shape by convention.

### The requested change

Add to `Attempt`:

```python
input_tokens: int | None = None
output_tokens: int | None = None
cache_read_input_tokens: int | None = None
cache_creation_input_tokens: int | None = None
cost_usd: float | None = None
```

Optional, defaulting to `None`, so every existing document remains valid and no
migration is required. `None` means "not reported", which is genuinely different
from zero -- a mock task reports nothing and did not cost nothing by accident.

### What it costs, and what it buys

**Costs:** five fields on the busiest document in the system, and a small write
on every attempt teardown.

**Buys:** cost and token usage become queryable per tenant, per profile and over
time. Today that question can only be answered by reading one GCS object per
attempt, which is correct and does not survive volume.

### Related work that is NOT part of this request

`submitted_by` is not filterable (`store.py:381-411` accepts `state`,
`workflow_id` and `runner_profile` only) and no Firestore index covers it
(`terraform/modules/firestore/indexes.tf`). Per-ENGINEER breakdown needs that
index regardless of this request. Both are unfrozen and can proceed
independently.

---

## 3. `models.py`: a typed `input_from` on `Task`

**Status:** open, recorded 2026-09-21. Raised in 5c99c79 ("input_from works;
work can be routed between agents for the first time") as one of "two
frozen-contract REQUESTS, raised rather than made" -- and then recorded in a
commit message, which is not a place anybody looks for an open decision.

### What is asked for

A field on `Task`, mirroring the one `WorkflowStep` already has:

```python
#: upstream TASK id -> artifact filename staged into this task's workspace.
input_from: dict[str, str] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

`WorkflowStep.input_from` is already typed (`models.py:333`) and is keyed by
upstream STEP id. `Task` has no equivalent, so the same declaration -- rewritten
to task ids, which is the form the worker can actually resolve -- travels in
`task.metadata`.

### What is restated today, and where

One idea, five spellings:

| where | type | keyed by |
|---|---|---|
| `swarm_common/models.py:333` `WorkflowStep.input_from` | `dict[str, str]` | step id |
| `swarm-api/schemas.py:80` `WorkflowStepCreate.input_from` | `dict[str, str]` | step id |
| `swarm-api/validation.py:358` `StepSpec.input_from` | `tuple[str, ...]` | step id, **no filenames** |
| `task.metadata["input_from"]` | untyped | **task id** |
| `swarm-ui/src/types.ts:1227` `WorkflowStep.input_from` | `string \| null` | -- |

**Written by exactly one place.** `swarm-api/service.py:354-357`, inside
`submit_workflow`, translating step ids to the task ids it has just minted:

```python
if source.input_from:
    task.metadata["input_from"] = {
        step_task_id[src]: filename for src, filename in source.input_from.items()
    }
```

**Read by exactly one place.** `agent-worker/agent_worker/inputs.py:56`
(`METADATA_KEY = "input_from"`) and `declared_inputs()` at `:109-154`, called
from `lifecycle.py:875-905` (`_stage_declared_inputs`). `declared_inputs` then
re-validates every key and every value at runtime -- the key is a non-empty
string, the value is a non-empty string, no two entries share a destination --
because the contract types `metadata` as `dict[str, Any]` and says nothing about
what is inside it. That defensiveness is correct and would still be wanted; the
request is about the fifth row of that table, and about the submission path that
never gets validated at all.

`StepSpec.input_from` being a *tuple of ids* is not sloppiness: `validate_dag`
needs to know which step a file comes from, not which file. It is listed because
it is a fourth shape somebody has to hold in their head while reading this.

### Why: the failure it prevents

**(a) The DAG rule is enforced on one submission path and not the other.**
`validation.py:373` states the rule -- "every `input_from` source is also an
upstream dependency" -- and `:412-425` enforces it, so a step cannot stage an
artifact from a step that may never have run. That check lives in the workflow
path. Meanwhile `reject_reserved_metadata` (`validation.py:242-255`) reserves
`dispatch` and nothing else, and
`tests/unit/control_plane/test_dispatch_strategy.py:572-573` pins that
`input_from` is deliberately allowed through:

```python
reject_reserved_metadata({"unit": "payments", "input_from": {"x": "y"}})
```

`_build_task` then copies caller metadata verbatim (`service.py:205`,
`metadata = dict(spec.metadata)`). So a plain `POST /v1/tasks` carrying
`metadata.input_from` is stored as written and honoured by the worker, having
passed none of the DAG checks.

Be precise about what that is and is not. It is **not** a tenant escape:
`inputs.fetch_upstream_task` (`inputs.py:226-254`) refuses a task belonging to
another tenant, and `inputs.artifact_key` (`:327-352`) builds the object key
from *this* attempt's tenant, so a cross-tenant artifact is unreachable by
construction. It is an **ordering** bypass inside one tenant: the caller names
any of their own tasks, with no dependency edge and no guarantee the upstream
ran. A typed field gives the API one field to validate on every path, instead of
one path validating a key the other path waves through.

**(b) The UI's copy is already wrong.** `codec.workflow_to_api:486` serves
`"input_from": s.input_from`, a `dict[str, str]`. `swarm-ui/src/types.ts:1227`
declares `input_from: string | null`, and the fixture at `api.ts:1185-1191`
builds it that way too, so the mock agrees with the wrong shape. Nothing renders
the field today, which is the only reason this has cost nothing -- a seam
declared at both ends with nothing in the middle.

### What it would break if accepted

* **No document migration.** `Task.to_firestore()` is `asdict(self)`, so new
  documents gain one key; `codec.task_from_dict` builds from named fields, so an
  older reader ignores it and an older document takes the default.
* **The rollout is the risky part, and it has a specific failure.** A worker
  image older than the API reads `metadata` only. If `service.py` stops writing
  `metadata["input_from"]` the moment the typed field exists, that worker sees
  no declaration, stages nothing, and runs the agent on a prompt written as
  though the file is there -- the exact silent-wrong-answer outcome
  `inputs.py`'s module docstring says must never happen. So: add the field, have
  the worker prefer it and fall back to metadata, ship both for a deploy window,
  and only then stop writing metadata.
* **`check-contract-parity.sh` gains nothing automatically.** It compares shell
  and jq to Python, and there is no shell restatement of this field.

### If it is declined

The worker keeps re-validating a free-form dict, which is defensible and is done
well today. Two things then need doing on the **unfrozen** side regardless, and
neither needs this request:

* `reject_reserved_metadata` should reserve `input_from`, or `_build_task`
  should validate it for a standalone task. Right now the DAG rule is
  enforceable on only one of the two ways a task is created.
* `swarm-ui/src/types.ts:1227` should be `Record<string, string>`. It is wrong
  today and nothing will tell anybody (see the closing section).

## 4. A typed artifact-manifest entry

**Status:** open, recorded 2026-09-21. Raised alongside #3 in 5c99c79: "a typed
artifact-manifest entry so check-contract-parity.sh can hold the producer and
the consumer together. Today they agree by convention, which is why the consumer
re-validates every key at runtime."

### The shape, and its single writer

`agent-worker/agent_worker/lifecycle.py:2110`, inside `_upload_outputs`:

```python
artifacts.append({"name": rel, "bytes": size, "uri": self.store.uri(key)})
```

placed into `result_summary` at `:2126-2134` beside `artifact_bytes` (int) and,
when the attempt hit its cap, `artifacts_skipped` (`list[str]`, truncated to 50).
`name` is a path relative to the artifacts directory, so it may contain
separators; `bytes` is `path.stat().st_size`; `uri` is whatever the store
rendered (`gs://...` in production, `file://...` locally).

### Every place that parses it

1. **`agent-worker/agent_worker/inputs.py:280-324`** -- `artifact_reference`.
   Reads `name`, `uri`, `bytes`. This is the one that resolves a declared input,
   and the one with the defect below.
2. **`swarm-mcp/swarm_mcp/patches.py:92-95`** -- `patch_uri`. Reads `name` and
   `uri` only, matching `result_summary.git.patch` against the manifest so a
   patch that failed to upload yields `None` rather than a link to nothing.
3. **`swarm-ui/src/AgentDetail.tsx:1439-1441`** -- shape-checks
   `summary.artifacts` is an array before casting, then `:1550-1556` renders
   `name`, `bytes` and `uri`, and `:1760` matches `git.patch` against `name`
   again.
4. **`swarm-ui/src/types.ts:345-349`** -- `ArtifactRef { name: string; bytes:
   number; uri: string }`. The cast at `AgentDetail.tsx:1440` checks "is it an
   array" and nothing further, so `bytes` is declared non-optional and is not.

A fifth thing shares the name and not the shape:
`agent-worker/agent_worker/runners/base.py:172` writes
`"artifacts": [<filename>, ...]` -- a list of **strings** -- into the runner's
`result.json`. It is not copied into `result_summary` (`lifecycle.py:697-707`
takes `status`, `summary`, `output` and `metrics` only), so the two do not
collide today. They are two identically-named fields with incompatible shapes in
one codebase, which is the ambiguity a named type removes.

### The defect nearby, and whether typing would have prevented it

`inputs.py:298-307`:

```python
size = entry.get("bytes")
return ArtifactReference(
    key=artifact_key(...),
    uri=uri,
    size_bytes=int(size) if isinstance(size, int) and not isinstance(size, bool) else 0,
)
```

Measured directly against that function (`uv run python`, five hand-built
manifest entries, nothing in the repository changed):

```
  bytes: int     -> size_bytes = 900000000
  bytes absent   -> size_bytes = 0
  bytes: str     -> size_bytes = 0
  bytes: float   -> size_bytes = 0
  bytes: True    -> size_bytes = 0
```

`stage_inputs:432-437` then sums `reference.size_bytes` and refuses the attempt
if the total exceeds `max_total_bytes`; the actual download at `:445` returns the
real size and is never compared to anything. So an entry whose `bytes` is
absent, a string, a float or a bool contributes **zero** to the cap and is then
fetched in full into a memory-backed tmpfs workspace. The comment at `:427-431`
says exactly what that cap is for: "an OOM kill several minutes into an agent
run is a far worse diagnosis than a refusal at setup."

**Would typing have prevented it? Half of it.**

* The half a type fixes: with `bytes` a required int at the boundary, the `0`
  has nowhere to come from. "Not reported" becomes a parse failure naming the
  upstream task and the file, instead of a silent zero -- and this module has
  already decided, in its own docstring, that a declared input which cannot be
  resolved fails the attempt rather than degrading quietly.
* The half it does not: the cap is computed from **declared** sizes and never
  re-checked against what arrived. A manifest that under-reports -- a truncated
  upload, a hand-edited document, a future writer that rounds -- walks through
  the same door with a perfect type in place. The fix that holds is a running
  total during pass 4 that aborts when the bytes actually downloaded exceed
  `max_total_bytes`.

That second half is **unfrozen**, lives in `inputs.py`, and should be fixed
whether or not this request is accepted. This entry must not become the reason
it waits.

### What it would break if accepted

* **Scope matters.** `Task.result_summary` and `Attempt.result_summary` are
  `dict[str, Any] | None`. Typing the whole summary would mean enumerating and
  freezing every key `lifecycle.py` writes (`git`, `logs`, `runner`,
  `checkpoint`, `restored_from`, `inputs`, `artifact_bytes`,
  `artifacts_skipped`) -- a far larger change than this request. The cheap,
  useful version is a dataclass for the **entry** alone, which nothing is forced
  to store and which every parser can construct from.
* **Strict parsing of history is plausible but unproven.** There has only ever
  been one writer and its shape has not changed, so every existing entry should
  carry all three keys. That has **not** been checked against production data,
  and it must be before anything parses strictly -- otherwise this request turns
  an under-counted cap into a failed attempt on an old artifact.
* `check-contract-parity.sh` could then hold the TypeScript `ArtifactRef` to it,
  except that it does not read TypeScript at all. See the closing section.

### If it is declined

`artifact_reference` keeps re-validating every key, which is the right thing to
do with an untyped dict, and `patches.py` and `AgentDetail.tsx` keep their own
defensive checks. The size-cap bypass above is fixed anyway, on the unfrozen
side. The cost is that four readers stay in agreement by convention, and the
fifth -- `ArtifactRef`, which claims `bytes: number` -- already is not.

---

## 5. `gke_api_host` in a shared module (proposed: `swarm_common/kube.py`)

**Status:** open, recorded 2026-09-21. c43844a ends its GKE-host section with
"the contract request to give it one owner is recorded rather than made." It was
not recorded anywhere a person would find it. This entry is that record.

### What is duplicated

`scheduler/dispatch.py:507-549` and `reconciler/backends.py:459-500`. Strip the
docstrings and comments and the two are byte-identical -- thirteen lines:

```python
raw = (endpoint or "").strip()
if not raw:
    return ""
scheme, separator, rest = raw.partition("://")
if not separator:
    rest = raw
elif scheme.lower() != "https":
    raise ValueError(
        "GKE_ENDPOINT must be a bare host or an https:// URL; "
        f"{scheme}:// would send the bearer token in clear text"
    )
rest = rest.rstrip("/")
if not rest:
    raise ValueError(f"GKE_ENDPOINT is not a usable host: {endpoint!r}")
return f"https://{rest}"
```

Verified by diffing the two comment-stripped bodies: no output. The docstrings
differ deliberately -- each names the other copy and states its *own* caller's
failure mode, which is the more useful half of what is written there.

### The claim behind the request, verified

The claim is that `apps/common` is the only directory both images carry. It
holds. Those are the only two `COPY apps/...` lines in either file:

| image | copies |
|---|---|
| `images/swarm-scheduler/Dockerfile:59-60` | `apps/common/`, `apps/scheduler/` |
| `images/swarm-reconciler/Dockerfile:61-62` | `apps/common/`, `apps/reconciler/` |

Each then builds exactly two wheels from those two directories
(`:65-66` and `:67-68` respectively) and installs its own service. So neither
image contains the other's package, neither can import the other, and
`swarm_common` is the only place a single copy could live inside both.

`apps/common/pyproject.toml` declares `dependencies = []` and
`packages = ["swarm_common"]`, so a stdlib-only module added there ships in both
images and adds no dependency to either. This function needs nothing but
`str.partition`.

### Why: the failure it prevents

The two copies **did** disagree, and the direction of the disagreement is the
point. The reconciler added the scheme; the scheduler did not. So every GKE
dispatch failed on a URL urllib3 could not route -- and it failed *after*
admission had already taken the lease. Invariant 3 counts concurrency from
`LEASED`, so the slot is held by a task committed to a backend that will never
start it. The reconciler, which is what would notice, was reading the same
cluster through the copy that worked.

What holds them together today is
`tests/unit/control_plane/test_gke_client_host.py:97`:

```python
assert scheduler_gke_api_host(endpoint) == reconciler_gke_api_host(endpoint)
```

That is a real guard and it does work. But it works only because the *test*
process can import both services, which neither *image* can -- the file says so
itself at lines 10-14. One test, importing two packages that never run in the
same process, is the entire structural connection between two copies of a
security-relevant string function. Delete the test and the copies are free.

### What it would break if accepted

* **It is an addition, not a change.** No existing type moves, no stored
  document changes, no wire format changes. That makes it the cheapest request
  in this file and the one with the least to argue about.
* Both call sites become imports. The two docstrings must move to the call
  sites rather than be lost with the duplicate: "the dispatch fails after the
  lease is taken" and "the reconciler goes blind on the GKE backend" are
  different facts about different callers, and both are worth keeping.
* The equality test should be **replaced, not deleted**: one test of the shared
  function, plus whatever already asserts that each service configures its
  client from it.
* CLAUDE.md rule 1 says never edit the files in that directory. Adding a file is
  not editing one, but it is still a change to the frozen package, which is
  exactly why this is a request and not a commit.

### If it is declined

Nothing breaks today, and the copies agree. The cost is that the only thing
standing between the next editor of either copy and a repeat of that outage is
one test file in a directory neither service builds -- and that the reasoning
for the duplication now lives in two docstrings that have to be kept accurate by
hand.

## 6. A typed dispatch block

**Status:** open, recorded 2026-09-21, from the defect fixed in 1cfdf57
("`integrate` promised ONE pull request and opened one per step").

### What is restated, and where

**swarm-api writes it.** `validation.py:186-229` resolves `DispatchOptions`
(`strategy`, `carrier`, `role`, `integrates`) and `to_metadata()` at `:222-229`
renders it into `task.metadata["dispatch"]` (`DISPATCH_METADATA_KEY`, `:175`).
The accepted vocabularies are `DISPATCH_STRATEGIES` (`:155`) and
`DISPATCH_CARRIERS` (`:161`).

**Two things read it back.**

* `codec.dispatch_of` (`:101-120`) -- for API callers. Fills absent fields with
  the API's defaults so a task predating the feature reads as
  `collect`/`checkpoints` rather than null, and `codec.workflow_dispatch`
  (`:122-149`) rolls that up to the workflow.
* `agent-worker/lifecycle.py:1611-1675` -- for the worker. Five accessors:
  `_dispatch_block`, `_dispatch_strategy`, `_dispatch_role`,
  `_dispatch_integrates`, `_dispatch_carrier`.

So three parsers, not two. `dispatch_of` and the worker deliberately disagree
about defaults, and that is correct -- one reports what a caller should *see*,
the other picks what is safe to *do*. What is not correct is the vocabulary.

### The drift that is already there

Measured by importing both sides:

```
swarm-api writes carrier in ('checkpoints', 'branches'), default 'checkpoints'

worker _dispatch_carrier body:
    value = self._dispatch_block().get("carrier")
    if not isinstance(value, str):
        return "patches"
    value = value.strip().lower()
    return value if value in ("patches", "branches") else "patches"
```

`checkpoints` -- the value on every task swarm-api has ever written that did not
ask for branches -- is not in the worker's accepted set, so `_dispatch_carrier()`
returns `"patches"` for it. And `"patches"` is a value swarm-api cannot produce:
`_accepted_value` (`validation.py:233-240`) refuses it at submission with the
accepted list in the error. Two sides of one field, and neither can say a word
the other accepts as the default.

**Today this costs nothing, and the reason matters.** `_dispatch_carrier` has no
caller in production code. Its only references are its own definition and
`tests/unit/worker/test_integrate_strategy.py:86-88`, which asserts the default
is `"patches"` -- pinning the disagreement into the suite rather than catching
it. 1cfdf57 says as much about the other end: "`carrier: "branches"` forced
`needs_repository` at submission and then changed no behaviour at all."

That is the shape of the two defects this repository fixed today: a seam built
at both ends with nothing in the middle, and a test that passes because it
agrees with the wrong side. The first change that wires the carrier up gets a
worker that reads every default dispatch as a carrier the API cannot name.

### Why: what a shared type prevents

Not the four-field read -- the worker reads all four now. It prevents the
vocabularies drifting apart again, which they already have. Concretely, a
`DispatchBlock` in the frozen package, owning the accepted values, would mean:

* one list of strategies and one list of carriers, imported by both sides
  instead of typed out twice;
* something for `check-contract-parity.sh` to assert. It covers nothing about
  dispatch today: its four checks are `SlotPool.effective_limit`,
  `Tenant.secret_name()`, the `TaskState` arrays, and the tenant-id budget;
* an explicit home for the worker's tolerance rules, which are **correct and
  must survive**. An unknown strategy reading as `collect` and an unknown role
  as `contributor` is the newer-control-plane/older-worker rule: in that
  disagreement the safe reading is the one that pushes nothing and opens
  nothing. That reasoning is currently in two docstrings and nowhere else.

### What it would break if accepted

* **Scope decides the risk.** A `DispatchBlock` dataclass plus a
  `from_metadata()` classmethod changes no stored document -- the block stays
  where it is, inside `metadata`. A typed *field* on `Task` would, and it
  carries the same rollout trap as #3 in the opposite direction: a worker older
  than the API would see no dispatch block, every `integrate` step would read as
  `collect`, and the workflow would run to completion publishing nothing. That
  is the failure 1cfdf57 fixed, arriving from the other side.
* **The tolerance rules must be part of the type's written contract.** If the
  next implementer makes `from_metadata()` strict, a version skew stops being a
  conservative downgrade and becomes a failed attempt.
* `tests/unit/worker/test_integrate_strategy.py:86-88` has to change. It
  currently asserts the wrong vocabulary.

### If it is declined

The carrier vocabulary still has to be reconciled. Both sides are **unfrozen**,
so that can be done today and should be: a dead accessor carrying constants the
writer cannot produce, with a test holding it in place, is a trap set for
whoever wires it up. Everything else keeps working by convention, re-parsed in
three places, with the frozen contract silent about a four-field block that
decides whether a workflow opens one pull request or five.

## 7. The workflow rollup has no shared home, so only one service can own it

**Status:** open, found 2026-09-22 while making `Workflow.state` advance at all.

### The problem

Nothing ever wrote `Workflow.state` after submission. It is now derived from the
step tasks and written back, and the derivation lives in
`apps/swarm-api/swarm_api/rollup.py`. It lives there because that is the only
place it CAN live and still be used by more than one service — and it is used by
exactly one.

The scheduler would have been the better home for the write. It already runs on a
guaranteed one-minute clock (`terraform/modules/scheduler/jobs.tf:3`, the safety
tick into the wake topic) and it already owns "state advances over time". It
cannot have the derivation, because:

```
images/swarm-scheduler/Dockerfile:59-60   COPY apps/common/  apps/scheduler/
images/swarm-api/Dockerfile:59-60         COPY apps/common/  apps/swarm-api/
```

Each image installs the frozen contract plus its own package. `swarm-scheduler`
cannot `import swarm_api` and `swarm-api` cannot `import scheduler`; a
cross-package import would be an `ImportError` in production and nowhere else,
which is the failure `apps/swarm-api/pyproject.toml` already carries a comment
about for `google-cloud-storage`.

So the choice was: one implementation in the API, or two implementations with a
cron. Two was refused, because the second copy would be compared against the
first by the drift check this feature also ships — and the check would then be
reporting the two copies drifting rather than the data drifting, which is worse
than no check.

### What the change would be

A new module in the frozen package — `swarm_common/rollup.py` — holding the pure
derivation only:

* the terminal-severity ranking (`DEAD_LETTERED > FAILED > CANCELLED > SUCCEEDED`)
* the pending precedence (`READY > PARKED > QUEUED > SUBMITTED`)
* `derive(readings) -> WorkflowRollup`
* the `UNKNOWN` sentinel and the rule that an incomplete read produces it

It defines no new dataclass field and changes no existing type. It is a pure
function over `TaskState` and a small result object, so it adds no dependency to
any image that does not already have `swarm_common`.

### What it buys

The scheduler's `_promote_dependencies` sweep (`scheduler/loop.py:472`) could then
do the write on the existing one-minute tick, and the API would derive for
display from the same function. One rule, two callers, nothing to drift.

### What breaks if it is made

Nothing imports it yet, so nothing breaks. The API's `swarm_api/rollup.py` would
keep the impure half — the store reads, the write-back, the metric — and import
the pure half instead of defining it.

### What is left to live with if it is declined

What ships today, which is not broken but is narrower than it should be:

* the write-back fires on every workflow READ, so the stored copy converges for
  any workflow anybody looks at — which is most of them, because the web UI polls
  `GET /v1/workflows?limit=100`;
* `POST /v1/admin/workflows/rollup` converges the rest on demand;
* **there is no periodic caller for that route.** A workflow nobody lists and
  nobody sweeps keeps a stale STORED state indefinitely. Every READER still sees
  the truth, because every read derives; it is the *queryable* copy that lags,
  which is the half the write exists for. Closing that needs either this request
  or a Cloud Scheduler job against the admin route, which is Track C.

## 8. `Workflow.state` reuses `TaskState`; a workflow needs its own vocabulary

**Status:** open, found 2026-09-22.

### The claim that is imprecise

`apps/common/swarm_common/models.py:344`:

```python
@dataclass
class Workflow:
    ...
    state: TaskState
```

A workflow is not a task, and the task vocabulary is the one available to
describe it. Most of it transfers cleanly — SUCCEEDED, FAILED, CANCELLED,
DEAD_LETTERED, RUNNING, READY, PARKED and QUEUED all mean at the workflow level
what they mean at the task level. Two things do not:

* **There is no word for a partial failure.** A workflow whose steps are
  SUCCEEDED, FAILED and CANCELLED derives FAILED, and "FAILED" is not wrong — but
  it cannot distinguish "every step failed" from "four of five succeeded".
  `rollup.counts` carries that today, and a caller filtering on state alone
  cannot see it.
* **`LEASED`, `DISPATCHED` and `STARTING` are meaningless for a workflow.** They
  describe one task's relationship to one lease. The derivation collapses all
  four capacity-holding states into RUNNING for exactly that reason, so three of
  the twelve values are unreachable for a workflow and nothing says so.

### What the change would be

A `WorkflowState` enum in `swarm_common/states.py` and `Workflow.state` retyped
to it:

```python
class WorkflowState(str, Enum):
    QUEUED = "QUEUED"
    RUNNING = "RUNNING"
    PARKED = "PARKED"
    SUCCEEDED = "SUCCEEDED"
    PARTIALLY_FAILED = "PARTIALLY_FAILED"   # some steps succeeded, some did not
    FAILED = "FAILED"
    CANCELLED = "CANCELLED"
```

### Why it was NOT done as part of the work that found it

`Workflow` is in the frozen contract, and the existing vocabulary can express
everything the platform currently needs to say. Deriving into `TaskState` needed
no contract change and is what shipped. This is the request, not a plan.

### What breaks if it is made

More than request #7, and it should be costed before anyone agrees:

* `codec.workflow_from_dict` decodes the stored field with `TaskState(...)`.
  Every workflow document written before the change holds `"QUEUED"`, which is
  in both enums, so the read survives — but any document holding `LEASED`,
  `DISPATCHED`, `STARTING` or `DEAD_LETTERED` would stop decoding. Nothing writes
  those today; nothing guarantees nothing ever did.
* `apps/swarm-ui/src/types.ts` widens `Workflow.state` to `string` already, so
  the UI tolerates a new value without a typecheck — which is the same property
  that let it tolerate a wrong one. `check-contract-parity.sh` does not cover
  TypeScript (see the surfaces table at the end of this file).
* `PARTIALLY_FAILED` is a genuinely new concept and needs a decision about
  whether it is terminal for the purposes of "list my failed workflows".

### What is left to live with if it is declined

The derivation stays inside `TaskState`, `rollup.counts` carries the partial
picture, and a caller wanting "mostly succeeded" reads the counts rather than the
state. That is what ships today and it is honest; it is just less queryable than
a named state would be.

## Why these requests keep arising

Four of the requests above -- #3, #4, #6 and #7 -- are one situation: a value
with a single definition and several readers, in components that cannot import
each other. #5 is the same situation with a function instead of a value, and #7
is the same situation with a RULE instead of a value -- which is the sharpest
form of it, because the thing that would notice the two copies drifting is the
drift check that one of the copies exists to feed.
`CONTRACT.md` permits a restatement where it is unavoidable, and
`docs/architecture.md` pays for the one it permits with a test. There are three
restatement surfaces in this repository. Two are paid for.

| surface | what holds it to the Python | run by |
|---|---|---|
| shell / jq | `scripts/lib/check-contract-parity.sh` -- four checks | `make test` (Makefile:164), and the `shell` job in `.github/workflows/application.yml` |
| Terraform's runner catalogue | `tests/terraform/catalogue.tftest.hcl` with `tests/terraform/catalogue_mirror/` | `make tf-test` |
| TypeScript | **nothing** | -- |

Verified rather than assumed, because an earlier report asserted it:

* `grep -c 'tsc\|typescript\|swarm-ui' scripts/lib/check-contract-parity.sh
  Makefile` -> `0` and `0`. The parity script reads no `.ts` file; its four
  checks are `SlotPool.effective_limit`, `Tenant.secret_name()`, the four
  `TaskState` arrays, and the tenant-id length budget.
* `grep -rc 'tsc\|npm \|typecheck\|swarm-ui' .github/workflows/` -> `0` in all
  four workflow files.
* `apps/swarm-ui/package.json` does define `"typecheck": "tsc -b --noEmit"`.
  Nothing in this repository runs it.

And running it would not help. `tsc` checks `types.ts` against itself; it has no
way to know what `swarm_common` says. Only a comparison, or a route, can.

What that costs, measured today:

| in `apps/swarm-ui/src/types.ts` | frozen source | state |
|---|---|---|
| `RESOURCE_UNITS` (`:1100`): standard 1, browser 2, large 4 | `profiles.RESOURCE_CLASSES` units 1 / 2 / 4 | agrees today. Hand-copied, and the comment at `:1096-1098` says so plainly |
| `TaskState` union (`:923-925`), 12 values | `states.TaskState`, 12 values | agrees |
| `QuotaState.state` (`:903`): `'HEALTHY' \| 'COOLDOWN' \| 'EXHAUSTED' \| 'DISABLED' \| string` | `models.ProviderState`: `AVAILABLE`, `THROTTLED`, `EXHAUSTED`, `COOLDOWN`, `UNKNOWN`, `DISABLED` | **drifted** |
| `WorkflowStep.input_from` (`:1227`): `string \| null` | `codec.workflow_to_api:486` serves `dict[str, str]` | **drifted** (request #3) |
| `ResourceClassSpec` (`:561`) | served by `GET /v1/resource-classes` | **not copied, deliberately** |

The `QuotaState` row is worth spelling out. There is no provider state called
`HEALTHY` anywhere in this platform -- the only other occurrence of the word in
the repository is an unrelated fixture name at `tests/unit/mcp/test_sc.py:28`.
Three states that *do* exist (`AVAILABLE`, `THROTTLED`, `UNKNOWN`) are missing
from the union. And the trailing `| string` widens the whole thing back to
`string`, so even a typechecker that ran would report nothing: the union
documents a vocabulary rather than enforcing one, and the vocabulary it
documents is wrong.

The last row is the remedy the repository has already found and used. The
comment at `types.ts:556-559` gives this exact reasoning for **not** copying the
resource-class numbers:

> `check-contract-parity.sh` asserts that shell and jq restatements of the
> frozen catalogue still match the Python; it does not cover TypeScript, so a
> copy here would drift the first time a class is resized and nothing would
> notice.

So somebody has already worked this out once, wrote a route instead of a copy,
and the two drifted rows above are what happens in the places where that was not
done.

Which gives the shape of the answer to all of these:

* where every reader is Python, a shared type ends it -- requests #3, #4, #5, #6;
* where one reader is jq or Terraform, a parity check ends it, and both exist;
* where one reader is TypeScript, nothing ends it today, and a route that serves
  the value is the only remedy this repository has actually made work.

## 9. `models.py`: `Lease.dispatch_overdue` excluded the leases it names

**Status: ACCEPTED and applied 2026-09-22, by the owner's decision.**

### The claim that was false

```python
def dispatch_overdue(self, now=None) -> bool:
    """Admitted but never started. The reconciler reclaims these."""
    return self.state is TaskState.LEASED and (now or utcnow()) > self.dispatch_deadline
```

`mark_dispatched` (`apps/scheduler/scheduler/store.py`) writes `DISPATCHED` to
the lease the moment the backend *accepts* the create call — long before a
container runs. So `state is TaskState.LEASED` was False for essentially every
lease whose dispatch was in flight, which is exactly the population the method
names. Measured on `task_b5dc2568713a40158851` on 2026-09-22: still False 301
seconds after admission.

### What it cost

* `apps/swarm-api/swarm_api/routes/admin.py:433` — the `overdue_only=1` filter
  is the query an operator runs during a capacity incident to find stuck
  dispatches. It returned an empty list at exactly the moment it was asked.
* `apps/swarm-api/swarm_api/codec.py:355` — `lease_to_api` reported
  `dispatch_overdue: false` on every lease the API served.
* `apps/swarm-ui/src/Overview.tsx` — narrowed again with
  `dispatch_state === 'LEASED' &&`, a second copy of a guard that had already
  emptied the set.

### Why no test caught it

The only test that touched the predicate asserted the KEY was present and never
its VALUE:

```python
for key in ("released", "expired", "dispatch_overdue"):
    assert key in body
```

A predicate is not covered by a test that checks it was spelled correctly. The
suite stayed green for weeks with the flag permanently False.

### What was applied

The `state is LEASED` guard was removed from the helper, the stale comment in
`codec.py` defending it was corrected, and the duplicate guard in `Overview.tsx`
was deleted. A `heartbeat_at is None` conjunct was deliberately NOT added: the
reconciler needs that distinction because it decides whether to fence a
generation, while this method answers the narrower question of whether the
deadline has passed.

Three tests were added in
`tests/unit/control_plane/test_leases_and_attempts_read_path.py`, and the fix
was proved by mutation — restoring the guard turns
`test_a_dispatched_lease_past_its_deadline_is_overdue` red.
