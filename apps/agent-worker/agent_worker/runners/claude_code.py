"""Runner: Claude Code, non-interactive.

The CLI is started in print mode with STREAMED JSON output (one event per line,
`--output-format stream-json --verbose`), in the attempt's isolated
work directory, with the tenant's credential in its environment and nothing else
from the worker's own environment. That credential is either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
(metered API access) or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (a Claude subscription token
from `claude setup-token`) -- whichever the tenant's secret supplies. Only the
one that is present is passed to the child.

About permissions: an interactive permission prompt in a non-interactive
container is a hang, not a safety feature -- nobody is there to answer it, and
the attempt would burn its whole timeout waiting. The real boundary is the
container itself: non-root, read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, a
workspace that is deleted afterwards and a NetworkPolicy that denies egress to
every other tenant's namespace. Within that box the agent is allowed to work
without asking, and the deployment can turn that off by setting
CLAUDE_CODE_ARGS.

WHY stream-json (#184, 2026-09-25). With `--output-format json` the CLI prints
ONE object when it ends and nothing before, so a running claude-code attempt
had nothing for the live tail to show, and the object it did print kept only
the final answer: the reference run (task_73b5f4d9ca3641fbb914) took seven
turns and recorded none of them. `stream-json` prints each event as it happens
-- the init record, every assistant block and tool call, every tool result,
the `rate_limit_event` readings the account pool wants, and the same `result`
event last -- and the CLI requires `--verbose` alongside it in print mode.
`cliagent` already parses a streamed run (`_parse_cli_output` returns the list
of events and `_spend_of` reads the last one that carries spend). The agent's
stdout capture, `claude-code.stdout.log`, is therefore NDJSON, and the worker
publishes its tail every five seconds while the attempt runs.
