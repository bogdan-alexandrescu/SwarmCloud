"""Submission guards.

Two separate jobs live here.

The first is the catalogue boundary (invariant 10): a caller names a
`runner_profile` and nothing else. Image, command, resource class, backend and
provider are all read from the FROZEN catalogue, never from the request. The
request schemas forbid unknown fields, so a caller who tries to smuggle
`image` or `backend` in gets a 422 rather than silently having it ignored.

The second is workflow DAG validation. A workflow whose `depends_on` graph has
a cycle would sit in DEPENDENCY_INCOMPLETE forever, holding no capacity but also
never completing and never erroring -- the worst kind of failure, because
nothing alerts. So the cycle is rejected at submission with the exact cycle
named. An `input_from` the worker would refuse gets the same treatment: caught
at run time, it is caught only after every upstream step has spent its compute.

# selects an image, a command, a resource class, a backend or a provider. They

# `apps/common/swarm_common/` is frozen and a new field on Task would be a
# frozen change. `metadata` is already the free-form per-dispatch dict and is
# already used this way (`metadata.unit` from swarm-mcp, `metadata.input_from`
# written by workflow submission below).

#: Accepted `strategy` values, in the order every refusal lists them.
#:
#:   collect     patches are harvested into the task's GCS prefix and nothing is
#:               pushed. The only strategy that works with a read-only token.

# `destination_for`), and it keeps doing so. That is defence in depth, and the
# only guard on a plain task that carries `metadata.input_from`. What checking
# here changes is WHEN the answer arrives. At run time it arrives after every
# upstream step has run. Measured 2026-09-25 on wf_1e547922a981411991e2, that
# was ~20 minutes of claude-code across nine steps, then four failed merges and
# seventeen cancellations, for a mistake visible in the request body (#64).
#
# THE RULE IS RESTATED BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE, AND A TEST HOLDS THE COPY. The
# swarm-api image ships apps/common and apps/swarm-api and nothing else, so
# `agent_worker` cannot be imported here.
# tests/unit/control_plane/test_input_from_submission.py runs the worker's own
# functions against these rules: every filename accepted here must pass the
# worker's `destination_for`, and the collision refused here must be one the
# worker refuses.
#
# THE WORKER'S RESERVED NAMES ARE NOT RESTATED. The worker derives `repo`,
# `.swarm` and the workspace control files from `Workspace` at run time, and a
# copy here would be the mirrored-value shape behind three outages in this
# repository (docs/mirrored-values.md). A reserved name is still refused: by
# the worker, at staging.

#: Path segments that make a filename name something other than a file inside
#: the step's workspace. "" comes from a leading, doubled or trailing "/".
#:
#: STRICTER THAN THE WORKER on "" and ".". `destination_for` normalises
#: `./notes.md` and `reports//notes.md` through `PurePosixPath` and would place
#: them. Refusing them costs nothing, because such a name can never MATCH an
#: artifact. The uploader names each artifact by its path relative to the
#: artifacts directory (`relative_to(...).as_posix()` in
#: `lifecycle._upload_outputs`), and that path never has an empty or "."
#: segment, so the worker would refuse the name one step later with "did not
#: produce an artifact named ...".
